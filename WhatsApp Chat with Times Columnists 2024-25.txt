The theme for Edition 65 is very scrapbook-y and 2000s magazine vibes. The cool interactive pages, with stickers all over them and where everything stood out. 

For the pulses this time, we‚Äôve got a bucket of ideas to choose from, feel free to add similar ones - we‚Äôve linked references for some, you can check those out as well and make them college related in a fun way. Think of it this way, if you were just a reader, what would make you the most interested? 

Please reach out to either @917678594191 or me regarding any doubts about the ideas or any possible new topics you guys want to work on, or suggestions for the existing ones. 

Please have a look and append your names next to an idea that you like, or a new idea that matches with the overall vibe by *Thursday, EOD.*

Hello Everyone! We have received a good number of entires for our columnists recruitments, but due to having PR drive getting extended we are running short on time, especially with the midsems approaching. So we kindly request all second and third years to look into evaluating the entries we have received, everything is in these two sheets.

Please ensure that the evaluation is accurate and comprehensive. Additionally, don't forget to include remarks or comments for each entry.

Your timely assistance in completing this task is greatly appreciated. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to reach out.

Please ensure all pending tasks are completed by *EOD* within your sections and keep the assistant editors in the loop, we‚Äôve already tagged you enough times. Avoid DMing unrelated people if you need help or time; keep discussions in the group.

12/13/24, 12:27 - Daksh: Hello Piratesüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è! 

The theme for Edition 66 is "The Open Seas" we will be showcasing this theme by utilizing the illustrations of ships and pirates on a journey, somewhat like a metaphor for the college journey that we're on OR the depth of the ocean and just how vast it is, again, symbolizing the larger than life aspect of our college journey. These are some insights from the meet we did yesterday, and as a writer you get to compose a creative piece, poem, flow chart type article, or even an interactive text based game. All based on the themes discussed. 

Please reach out to either @919667708532 or me regarding any doubts about the ideas or any possible new topics you guys want to work on.

Please have a look to the sheet and append your names and a small Description/Idea that you like, or a new idea that matches with the overall theme by *Sunday, EOD*.

12/29/24, 12:32 - Navya Times: Hello everyone! 

We will be starting with the mtt interviews soon. This is an annual prolonged sessions of interviews that the columnists take of the outgoing council, a nice conversational sit-down, where the seniors are asked questions about their life in DTU, their humble beginnings in Times leading up to their position now. 
Not only does it give seniors a chance to reflect on what they leave behind, but it is also an opportunity for the current members of the team to interact with them.

@columnists please volunteer in pairs for each senior
@editors please volunteer for at least 2 interviews each (I promise these are super fun so sab log volunteer karna)

React ASAP
1/12/25, 15:23 - Syed Zain Askari: Hello new Columnists. From the Interview Section this edition we have noticed a few common issues y'all had made during transcription. We didn't have much time during this edition to guide you all properly and we appreciate you working promptly, but here are some pointers you should always consider while transcribing.

‚Ä¢ Firstly your transcription is supposed to be formal retelling. So no, you are not supposed to transcribe filler words or phrases like "umm" "soo" etc. 

‚Ä¢ Secondly you need not transcribe each and every word spoken. You should listen to the interview once, and decide what you think is useful and then transcribe that in your own words, unless the interviewee gave any good quotes.

‚Ä¢ Do make sure to form proper coherent sentences, doesn't matter if the the interviewee didn't, we are supposed to make them sound formal and keep reader interests for our publications.

‚Ä¢ Lastly please run grammar checks on your transcriptions before handing them in. It saves everyone alot of time

These guidelines should be followed as rule of thumb for all interviews in future so please keep them in mind. üí´ <This message was edited>
