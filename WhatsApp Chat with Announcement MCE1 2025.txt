1/1/24, 00:47 - Ayush Chahar: As we embark on another year together, I wanted to take a moment to extend my warmest New Year wishes to you all. May the coming year be filled with boundless opportunities, remarkable achievements, and moments of joy that make our collective academic experience truly unforgettable.

As we navigate through the challenges of this year, let's embrace each hurdle as a stepping stone to success. May you find inspiration in every lesson, strength in every difficulty, and growth in every experience. Each day is a new page in the book of our academic adventure, and I'm confident that together, we'll script a narrative of excellence.

May the upcoming months be marked by breakthroughs in our studies, collaborative triumphs in our projects, and the satisfaction of overcoming every academic milestone. Let's continue to support each other, share knowledge, and foster an environment where everyone can thrive.

Here's to a year of discovery, perseverance, and accomplishment! May 2024 be the year that propels us closer to our goals and aspirations.

Cheers to 2024! 🎉

Happy New Year! 🌟
Let's make it a memorable one.🥂✨

AICTE Approved institutions

Greetings from AICTE !

As you are already aware that Yuva Sangam is a flagship program of the Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat (EBSB) initiative, launched by the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India. This initiative focuses on conducting exposure tours of the youths comprising mainly students studying in Higher Educational institutions (HEIs) & some off-campus youths from one state to other states & vice versa. It provides an immersive experience of various facets of life, development landmarks, recent achievements and a youth connect in the host state. The program aims to promote national integration and understanding by connecting youth from different parts of the country through educational and cultural exchanges.

In addition to the cultural exchange, Yuva Sangam also includes a number of other activities that are designed to help students develop their leadership, sports and soft skills. For example, students may get an opportunity not only to participate in workshops on leadership, communication, and teamwork but also sports events that may be organised by SAI. They will also have the opportunity to meet and interact with VVIPs, celebrities or important personalities of the host state.

The success of earlier phases of Yuva Sangam are a testament to the importance of investing in youth and building bridges between different communities. The program has had a positive impact on the lives of thousands of youth and has helped to build a more united and inclusive India.

I request your support in motivating students of your institution to register for Yuva Sangam Phase-4, a student exchange program under EBSB. 

All interested students can register online at https://ebsb.aicte-india.org/

The registration has started on 25-01-2024 and the last date is 04-02-2024.

Please find attached a document on how to inspire students to register for Yuva Sangam.

This is to bring to ur kind attention that under NAAC  Criteria 2, there is a component of Student Satisfaction Survey wherein a mail from "assessment.noreply@naac.gov.in" with the subject line as "NAAC Student Survey Form" has already been sent by NAAC to around 600-700 Students randomly and only 1.9% of the students  have presently filled the student feedback.... Even after repeated communication, meetings and reminders at various levels, this number has not yet increased.... the last date for feedback submission is 30th October and it has a good weightage of 30 marks....All the HoDs are requested to convey and advise students to fill up the survey on priority....
